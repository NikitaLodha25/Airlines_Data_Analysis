# Airlines Data Analysis Using SQL

## The goal of this data analysis is to go through the data of various tables provided in the airlines database and find out different useful information from it.

This airlines database has been taken from *Kaggle* and is available there for use.

The basic queries involve joining multiple tables and provide valuable insights for both the airlines department and customers, helping them better understand flight operations, passenger data, and overall performance.

Some questions are as follows:

```
For a given flight, list all the passengers with their seat numbers and fare conditions.

How many seats are available in each fare condition on a specific aircraft?

List all flights along with their ticket numbers, fare conditions, and corresponding ticket amounts.

Find the total number of passengers who have booked tickets for a specific flight.

Identify the most popular aircraft model based on the number of flights it operates.

List all flights along with the names of their departure and arrival airports and their respective cities.

List all flights that have not departed yet (status is 'Scheduled') and the number of available seats for each flight.
